# Announcements:
Our first meetings are Tuesday January 17th and Wednesday January 18th, from 13h - 17h. <br>
In preparation, please do Assignment 0.

## Overview:
This course will introduce students to the CIID process of Interaction Design - from research to prototyping - with weekly readings, lectures and activities that will equip students with methodological knowledge as well as practical, hands-on techniques to think through and flesh out their designs. We will focus our efforts under an engaging research topic, design challenge and its subset of questions over the course of 4 weeks.<br>
In the following 5 weeks, students will take their thoroughly researched and prototyped concepts and continue to see them through to their full form at which point they will show the work at a museum or other public space in Copenhagen.

## Weekly Structure
Each week, four dimensions will define our axes of efforts:
1. Context: what does it mean to design for museums? For public space? We will continuously study this context by getting out into the field and observing, interviewing and prototyping to learn more about the context.
2. Content: we will consider the overarching topic of "European heritage in the age of migrations." Within this, we will consider multigenerational heritage - how do different generations represent their heritage? What tools do they use? Questions such as these will center our reading, field research and concepts on issues related to European heritage.
3. Method: we will use principles of interaction design, specifically "people-centered design" as the path we travel in order to achieve our goal.
4. Goal: we will keep in mind our goal of designing creative-practice interventions that nourish and sustain dialogue about heritage for visitors of museums, galleries and heritage sites.

Types of activities:
1. Field research (observations, interviews)
2. Desk research (readings, videos, etc.)
3. Diagetic + Speculative Prototyping (low-fidelity demonstrations of ideas)
4. Co-creation / Testing (in public space / with possible participants)
5. Obsessive documentation (high-quality video footage of all work)
6. Summarization (as short text, photographs, diagrams, edited videos)

Sharing process:
- You are welcome to use a Google Drive / Dropbox / etc. folder, Tumblr page, your own website. Send the class the link and make sure your teammates can access and contribute to it.
- All documentation should be finished and shared on Sunday morning at the latest so that we can consider it and incorporate corresponding exercises and suggestions in the Monday afternoon class time.
- I will keep this page up to date with all resources and assignments.

**You MUST have individuals' consent if you make any direct recording of them. T1his is a crucial principle of design research.**

# Expectations
1. Continuous documentation and editing. You must gather high quality documentation through video and photograhs. Use the camera that you will get from the school (Jeppe Lawaetz) and document constantly as well as editing your video and photograph footage after each session.
2. Post progress each day on blog as continuous stream of documentation of what you are doing
3. Post response to assignment on Sunday morning (at the latest) so that I can review it before class on Mondays
4. Actively participate in classroom activities and group work
5. (Be on time for class and for your group meetings)
6. Work with me to make the class the best it can be!

## Research Topic
As part of an ongoing European Union project, our class will consider the topic of constructing and representing European heritage in this age of migrations.<br>
Within this overall topic, we seek to encourage deeper dialogue about European heritage-identity, specifically within the context of galleries, museums, heritage-sites, specifically with the mechanism of creative-practice interventions.<br>
Creative-practice interventions can be defined as interactive installations.<br>
How is heritage-identity expressed/shifted during/through dialogue?
Can you design an intervention that allows participants to engage in the process of that intervention's design? As in, a modular set of tools for dialogue, where participants choose which to keep and which to discard. As in, a physical space that can be deconstructed to allow participants to express themselves more fully.<br>
How can we use diagetic prototyping / speculative prototyping to bring participants into our world?

**Assignment 0: Getting Started**
Before we meet on Tuesday afternoon, we'd like for you to prepare and explore in the following ways.<br>
- Read:
  - On heritage, identity and storytelling:
    - [<kbd>Heritage and Identity</kbd>](http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/tha-website/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Heritage-and-Identity-talk-Rhiannon-Mason.pdf), by Rhiannon Mason
    - [<kbd>Conversations with grandma</kbd>](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/conversations-with-grandma-when-going-to-get-married?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet)
  - On interaction design: pick 1.
    - [<kbd>Designing Interactions</kbd>](http://www.paulos.net/teaching/2009/AE/readings/protected/Designing_Interactions.pdf), by Bill Moggridge
    - [<kbd>Design is what people do</kbd>](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=797), by Bill Verplank
- Do:
  - Set up blog and send me a link (can be on tumblr, or even a google docs page that you share with the class)
  - Contact Jeppe Lawaetz to get a high quality camera that can take video as well
- Go:
  - Observations at a museum: pick any museum and go. Plan to spend at least 45 minutes there. The goal is to observe how people interact with the space, with one another, with the exhibited content, with their personal devices throughout the experience. Eventually you will be designing an experience for a museum or similarly shared public space
    - Ask yourself the following questions:
      - How do people interact with one another around the "content" of the exhibit?
      - How do they choose to enter and exit various pieces of content or spaces?
      - What leads to their spending more or less time with various areas? Space design? Sound design?
      - Are there any ways for them to input their perspective or **interact** with what they are reading, seeing, experiencing?
      - Try to listen in to conversations of the other visitors. **Which elements, if any, lead to prolonged discussion?**
    - Observe and photograph examples of interactions in the environment
    - Define the problem that each interaction responds to (and the result of the solution, both intended and unintended)
    - Present your photos and be prepared to discuss your findings
- Sum:
  - Readings: please note your reading in the following ways.
    - 1-3 quotations per reading
    - 1-3 sketches per reading that show main concepts that stuck with you
    - Captions for sketch that explain why this concept stuck with you
  - Blog: send me the link
  - Observations: note (write in bullet points) where you went, any remarks about the space, setting, sound design "affordances" of the space. Upload high quality video and photographs of the particular interactions you would like to share with the class

## WEEK 1: THE INSIDE
Introduction to IXD, CoHERE topic, CIID approach of people-centered research <br>
How we learn: interviews, field research

### Class I: Tuesday
- Intro to course structure
- Intro lecture:
  - What is IxD?
      - Foundations Overview (aesthetic, practice, affordance)
- CoHERE Project Overview + Brief
- Exercise: Prototype a device, system, or service that addresses the problem in a culturally contextual way.
  - The core of the solution must be based around a key interaction.

### Class II: Wednesday

**Assignment Week 1:**
How do you invite people in to your experience?<br>
How does the physical, visual and audio set-up impact their perception and their mind-set upon entrance?<br>
What are the sensual triggers for wayfinding (audio, visual, smell, touch, etc.)?<br>
- Observe and document successful invitations. Note why you think they brought people in.
- Isolate one invitation and diagram the components on which the intervention places emphasis (or not).
- Based on your observations, create two invitations and test them in real life public spaces.

## WEEK 2: THE INSIDE (cont'd)
Tools for cocreation.

### Class I: Monday
- Intro to course structure

### Class II: Tuesday
- Intro to course structure

**Assignment Week 2:**
What do you hope people will do once inside?<br>
What makes people engage with one another?<br>
Observe instances of people engaging in dialogue in public space.<br>
Create a diagram that explains the patterns you observe.<br>
Consider some of the different distinctions that may be present:
- Are the people in a dialogue with others or themselves (an inner dialogue)? Do they know one another or are they strangers?
- Where do you observe the dialogue? What do you notice about the constraints of that environment that may guide the potential for engagement?
- How long and how deep is the dialogue? What made one party or the other engage for longer or exit earlier?
Isolate one observation that you can use as a jumping point for a design intervention.
Identify at least two individuals you can interview about this observation. Prepare your questions and tools / materials for a cocreation session. How can they help you come up with a possible intervention that would question / solve / alert / provoke?

Reminder: your goal is to incite dialogue (and thus expression) on multigenerational heritage.
