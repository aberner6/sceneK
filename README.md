#Announcements:
Our first meetings are Tuesday January 17th and Wednesday January 18th, from 13h - 17h.
In preparation, please do Assignment 0.

## Overview:
This course will introduce students to the CIID process of Interaction Design - from research to prototyping - with weekly readings, lectures and activities that will equip students with methodological knowledge as well as practical, hands-on techniques to think through and flesh out their designs. We will focus our efforts under an engaging research topic, design challenge and its subset of questions over the course of 4 weeks.
In the following 5 weeks, students will take their thoroughly researched and prototyped concepts and continue to see them through to their full form at which point they will show the work at a museum or other public space in Copenhagen.

## Weekly Structure
Each week, four dimensions will define our axes of efforts:
1. Context: what does it mean to design for museums? For public space? We will continuously study this context by getting out into the field and observing, interviewing and prototyping to learn more about the context.
2. Content: we will consider the overarching topic of "European heritage in the age of migrations." Within this, we will consider multigenerational heritage - how do different generations represent their heritage? What tools do they use? Questions such as these will center our reading, field research and concepts on issues related to European heritage.
3. Method: we will use principles of interaction design, specifically "people-centered design" as the path we travel in order to achieve our goal.
4. Goal: we will keep in mind our goal of designing creative-practice interventions that nourish and sustain dialogue about heritage for visitors of museums, galleries and heritage sites.

Types of activities:
1. Field research (observations, interviews)
2. Desk research (readings, videos, etc.)
3. Diagetic + Speculative Prototyping (low-fidelity demonstrations of ideas)
4. Co-creation / Testing (in public space / with possible participants)
5. Obsessive documentation (high-quality video footage of all work)
6. Summarization (as short text, photographs, diagrams, edited videos)

Sharing process:
- You are welcome to use a Google Drive / Dropbox / etc. folder, Tumblr page, your own website. Send the class the link and make sure your teammates can access and contribute to it.
- All documentation should be finished and shared on Sunday morning at the latest so that we can consider it and incorporate corresponding exercises and suggestions in the Monday afternoon class time.
- I will keep this page up to date with all resources and assignments.

**You MUST have individuals' consent if you make any direct recording of them. T1his is a crucial principle of design research.**

## Research Topic
As part of an ongoing European Union project, our class will consider the topic of constructing and representing European heritage in this age of migrations.
Within this overall topic, we seek to encourage deeper dialogue about European heritage-identity, specifically within the context of galleries, museums, heritage-sites, specifically with the mechanism of creative-practice interventions.
Creative-practice interventions can be defined as interactive installations.
How is heritage-identity expressed/shifted during/through dialogue?
Can you design an intervention that allows participants to engage in the process of that intervention's design? As in, a modular set of tools for dialogue, where participants choose which to keep and which to discard. As in, a physical space that can be deconstructed to allow participants to express themselves more fully.
How can we use diagetic prototyping / speculative prototyping to bring participants into our world?

### Week 1: The Invitation
Tools for field research, guerilla interviews.

### Assignment 1:
How do you invite people in to your experience?
How does the physical, visual and audio set-up impact their perception and their mind-set upon entrance?
What are the sensual triggers for wayfinding (audio, visual, smell, touch, etc.)?
- Observe and document successful invitations. Note why you think they brought people in.
- Isolate one invitation and diagram the components on which the intervention places emphasis (or not).
- Based on your observations, create two invitations and test them in real life public spaces.
- Interview at least two individuals who engage or do not engage with your invitation (remember: consent forms)

### Week 2: The Inside
Tools for cocreation.

### Assignment 2:
What do you hope people will do once inside?
What makes people engage with one another?
Observe instances of people engaging in dialogue in public space.
Create a diagram that explains the patterns you observe.
Consider some of the different distinctions that may be present:
- Are the people in a dialogue with others or themselves (an inner dialogue)? Do they know one another or are they strangers?
- Where do you observe the dialogue? What do you notice about the constraints of that environment that may guide the potential for engagement?
- How long and how deep is the dialogue? What made one party or the other engage for longer or exit earlier?
Isolate one observation that you can use as a jumping point for a design intervention.
Identify at least two individuals you can interview about this observation. Prepare your questions and tools / materials for a cocreation session. How can they help you come up with a possible intervention that would question / solve / alert / provoke?

Reminder: your goal is to incite dialogue (and thus expression) on multigenerational heritage.
